	<p> Have you even wanted to see your favorite non-Starcraft character appear in Starcraft 2? Maybe you wanted to make a Pokemon, Sonic the Hedgehog, or Naruto themed
	map for the Starcraft 2 arcade and don't want to pretend that a a Tal'darim Zealot is Shadow the Hedgehog (for example).

	With this innovative model conversion technique I developed, now you can do all of those things. "Madness" you say (or perhaps "fanfiction" you say)?
	This isn't madness or fanfiction, this is modding!
